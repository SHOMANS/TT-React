create new page called todos.
you should implement all CRUD functions on your data by useReducer hook.
there is a form for create and update.
before anything create a mock data to use.
when you create a todo, the id should be auto generated.
you should create actions constants types in a object.
every todo item should have its delete and edit button.
when you click on edit button, the data should be displayed on the form.
when you submit the changes on create or update, the form should be cleared.

addition: create all this logic in a custom hook and use it in a context.
