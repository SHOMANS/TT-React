- clone the repo from github and use branch session-20
- install the deps to use them from node_modules
- create new slice by redux called posts
- create CRUD with those posts using redux with your custom actions
- don't change my code, there will be 3 slices (counter, todos, posts)
- when deleting, creating, and updating you should use loading.
- the api is fake, so, it wouldn't change the data on api, you should apply the changes locally.
